Hi all,

My name is Bryant and I'm a student at Metro State University of Denver. I'm pursuing a Bachelor's degree in computer science with a minor in mathematics. Redding, CA is where I first called home, but after moving to Denver and meeting my wife, I have decided this is where I'll stay for now.
